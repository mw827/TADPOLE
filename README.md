# TADPOLE
This is for the TADPOLE (The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution) project, using past clinical test 
measurements  to predict future clinical test data and diagnosis.

1. Run Baseline.ipynb first, this is the baseline model which is the move-forward method. Using the last availabel 
clinical test as the data for future predictions

2. Run data_cleaning.ipynb and Models.ipynb, which is to do data cleaning and run models such as SVM, NN etc.

3. Run LSTM_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb and Dynamic_LSTM_train.ipynb to preprocess data for LSTM model and run the model
